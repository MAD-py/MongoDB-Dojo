# Practical Example

In this dojo we will explore how to implement a basic CRUD with Python, Nodejs, go and from the **MongoDB** shell. For this we are going to simulate an online course platform that requires to have a list of available courses and another list with users with all the courses they have completed and all the courses they have started.

## Entities

Entities in **MongoDB** can be understood as collections since one always seeks to store documents with a similar meaning in the same collection, for this example we will use two entities which are the courses of the platform and the users.

### Course

This collection will have as base the following fields (remember that **MongoDB** is NoSQL and not all the documents of a collection have to have the same fields).

```json
{
    "_id": "612d1e835ebee16872a109a4",
    "name": "Cloud Computing I",
    "instructor": {
        "name": "Jose Gomez Gomez",
        "email": "josegg@gmail.com"
    },
    "price": "$45.78",
    "certifies": true
}
```

Some of the courses will have an extra field that refers to a second instructor in the course, this field will be called "*co_instructor*" and will be the same type as the "*instructor*" field.

```json
{
    "_id": "800d1e735ufuue16122a001t1",
    "name": "Cloud Computing II",
    "instructor": {
        "name": "Jose Gomez Gomez",
        "email": "josegg@gmail.com"
    },
    "co_instructor": {
        "name": "Juan Zapata Gomez",
        "email": "jzg@gmail.com"
    },
    "price": "$38.00",
    "certifies": true
}
```

## User

This collection will have references to course collection and base information of user.

```json
{
    "_id": "642d1e835ebff16872b239a4",
    "name": "Emanuel",
    "last_name": "Rojas Moreno",
    "emails": [
        {
            "email": "emanuel.rojas@gmail.com",
            "type": "academic",
        },
        {
            "email": "ema123@gmail.com",
            "type": "personal",
        }
    ],
    "courses": {
        "completed": [
            "612d1e835ebee16872a109a4",
            "732d1e835fgff12172a199a4"
        ],
        "started": ["f783k1e825eboe16872a203b3"]
    }
}
```

*Note: The "_id" field is the unique identifier within the collection, this value is usually a uuid auto generated by **MongoDB***

---
Now that we know which entities we will use in our example, it is time to create a CRUD base for each of these, in this dojo we will work on Python, [Nodejs](./nodejs/README.md), go and [**MongoDB** Shell](./shell/README.md). Feel free to review the crud implementation in the language of your interest.
